// Write a program to input a name(as a single character) and marks of three tests as m1, m2, and m3 of a student considering all the three marks
//have been given in integer format.
//Now, you need to calculate the average of the given marks and print it along with the name as mentioned in the output format section.
//All the test marks are in integers and hence calculate the average in integer as well. That is, you need to print the integer part 
//of the average only and neglect the decimal part.

//Sample Input 1 :
//A
//3 4 6
//Sample Output 1 :
//A
//4
//Sample Input 2 :
//T
//7 3 8
//Sample Output 2 :
//T
//6
